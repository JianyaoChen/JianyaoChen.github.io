## About Me

I am a **Ph.D. Candidate in Information Science** at the School of Information Studies, University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. I am currently **seeking postdoctoral opportunities**.

My doctoral research examines **PTSD-related discussions in online health communities**. Using a mixed-methods approach, I investigate how individuals express emotions, seek and provide social support, manage privacy-related self-disclosure, and encounter misinformation in digital mental health contexts. Methodologically, my work integrates computational text analysis and quantitative research methods, including large-scale social media data collection, natural language processing, deep learning, large language models, and statistical modeling.
